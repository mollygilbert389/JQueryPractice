# JQueryPractice
This was actually a pretty neat little app I built to get a small cert in JQuery. 

Project 1: Using JQuery to add and remove elements (shapes) with a click function. Then adding in some animation for when they reappear. 

Project 2: Using a dropdown menu, the user can add the shape of their choosing in the color of their choosing. The app also adds numbers counting the shapes. 

Project 2: App that adds color to a flower image when clicked and dragged on top using only HTML CSS and JQuery.
