# JQueryPractice
This was actually a pretty neat little app I built to get a small cert in JQuery. 

Project 1: Using JQuery to add and remove elements (shapes) with a click function. Then adding in some animation for when they reappear. 

Project 2: Using a dropdown menu, the user can add the shape of their choosing in the color of their choosing. The app also adds numbers counting the shapes.

Project 3: App that builds a list if you've checked items off using only JQuery and HTML. 

Project 4: App that draws boxes for you when the user clicks on two points on the canvas, and also tells you the coordinates of your mouse clicks in the top left corner.
