# JQueryPractice
Just fine tuning my JQuery. Nothing to see here. This was actually a pretty neat little app I built to get a small cert in JQuery. 

Project 1: App that draws squares on a canvas only using HTML CSS and JQuery
Project 2: App that adds color to a flower image when clicked and dragged on top using only HTML CSS and JQuery.
